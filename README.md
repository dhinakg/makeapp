# makeapp
Creates a Install macOS .app from a gibMacOS full install.

Usage:
1. Save it in the same directory as where the gibMacOS download is. (for example, `~/Documents/GitHub/gibMacOS/macOS Downloads/developer/041-94934 - 10.15 macOS Catalina Beta/makeapp.command` for me)
2. Open Terminal, `cd` to the directory.
3. `chmod +x makeapp.command`
4. Then run with either `./makeapp.sh` or double-click. It should do the rest and will output `Done` once done.
